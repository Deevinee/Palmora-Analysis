# Palmora-Analysis

This is my Palmora Analysis project where i will be giving my insight and recommendation regarding the project.

## Project Topic: HR Data Insight: Bridging Gender and Salary Gaps At Palamora Group

### Project Overview
This analysis of Palmora Group’s HR dashboard reveals key trends in gender distribution, salary structure, regional differences, and performance ratings. The data highlights a gender imbalance in technical roles, a gender pay gap, and regional salary disparities, with Lagos offering higher pay. It also shows a concentration of employees in the top salary tier and potential bias in performance ratings.

### Key Insight From My Analysis

#### Gender Distribution by Department
Insight: There is a noticeable gender imbalance in technical and leadership roles.
#### Gender by Region
Insight: Female representation is stronger in Kaduna, suggesting a possible regional bias or hiring trend.
#### Gender Rating
Insight: Performance ratings may not be equally distributed by gender, which could reflect unconscious bias or differences in evaluation criteria.
#### Salary Range by Region
Insight: Lagos offers the highest-paying roles, likely due to cost of living, industry presence, or senior positions.
#### Salary Range by Employee Count
Insight: The company has a top-heavy salary structure, which could indicate experienced or managerial-heavy workforce.
#### Average Salary by Gender
Insight: While gender distribution is balanced, males earn slightly more, suggesting a gender pay gap.
#### Average Salary by Region
Insight: Again, Lagos shows higher compensation, supporting the idea of regionally-influenced pay structure.

### Recommendations

1. Address Gender Pay Disparity
	•	Conduct a pay equity audit to understand salary differences and adjust where necessary.
	•	Promote transparency in compensation policies.

2. Encourage Diversity in Male-Dominated Departments
	•	Launch targeted recruitment for women in technical fields like Engineering and Sales.
	•	Offer mentorship and training programs to support career growth for underrepresented groups.

3. Review Performance Rating Process
	•	Ensure rating systems are unbiased and standardized.
	•	Train managers on unconscious bias and fair evaluation practices.

4. Balance Salary Distribution
	•	Evaluate whether the high number of employees in the top salary range aligns with company profitability and structure.
	•	Offer growth opportunities and performance-based increments for mid- and lower-tier employees.

5. Leverage Regional Strengths
	•	Kaduna seems to have a strong female workforce—consider replicating that model in other regions.
	•	Investigate cost-of-living adjustments and regional performance differences to guide equitable pay policies.
